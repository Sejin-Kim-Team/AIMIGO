These systems are designed to mimic the human brain\'s ability to learn, understand, and make decisions. They use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to automate reasoning, problem-solving, and data analysis. Cognitive computing systems can understand, learn from, and respond to human language, making them capable of more complex tasks than traditional computing systems.' }, { sender: 'xrolfwn8kluyghcbaj51', time: '2023-07-24T08:45:06.983Z', message: 'how are you my friend?' }, { sender: 'Sejin Kim', time: '2023-07-24T08:45:10.339Z', message: 'As an artificial intelligence, I don\'t have feelings, but I\'m here and ready to assist you.
